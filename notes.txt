stop appium server through command line?

Run ps -A | grep appium
Note the process ID
Run kill [process ID]

OR: killall appium-desktop


And close the port:
sudo ss -tulwn | grep LISTEN



If EADDRINUSE, Address already in use is the issue:
ps aux | grep node   to get the process ids.
kill -9 PID
Doing the -9 on kill sends a SIGKILL
